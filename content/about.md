# Hello, I'm Blaine! 

I'm looking for new opportunities! I'm great at working with people to understand problems and co-create software solutions. I have extensive experience with all aspects of product delivery, including gathering requirements, designing solutions, and leading implementation teams. 

My resume, references, and all the rest are on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wbprice/). Rather than list those things off, I'm borrowing this Q&A format from an application I filled out recently. 

## "Brag to us about your most interesting project or side project."

One of my favorite side projects right now is a restaurant simulation game called "The Ten Top". The name comes from a sandwich shop near my house that makes a mean lamb sandwich.

The goal of the game is to make a living running a restaurant long enough to sell out and retire to a beach. I started writing about it on my blog: [https://blaineprice.me/posts/rustlang-up-some-grub/](https://blaineprice.me/posts/rustlang-up-some-grub/)

## "Please speak about your openness to travel for client on-sites, kick-offs, and workshops."

My last position required 25% travel for project kickoffs, project checkpoints, and such. Slack, Hangouts, and email are good tools for remote workers. That said, face-to-face time with the client is invaluable, so I'm fine with traveling.

## "If you have worked remotely before speak about what you did and didn't like?"

Remote work has been a net positive for my work/life balance so far. I've been working in a flex remote setting for the past 4 years. I had an office to go in to, but for the most part I was working with teams in other parts of the country anyway. There's enormous social value that comes out of having an office to go to, but these days coworking spaces and meetups can make up for missing that.

## "What programming languages are you expert/proficient in?"

In descending order: NodeJS, Python, Rustlang, Golang.

## "Do you want to spend more time or less time doing writing code? Why?"

This is a tough question. I enjoy the all the trappings of writing code. Yet, most of what I've written in the past two years is glue code stringing cloud services together.

I was writing a simple REST API to talk to a DynamoDB table the other day and thought: "Why isn't this all YAML?" and "Why isn't there a GUI for this?" (And then I understood some of the fuss around Azure Logic Apps).

I like writing code, but the best code is "no code". Arranging systems and services to solve a problem is more interesting than coding to me.

## "List all AWS services with which you have direct experience."

Lambda, Step Functions, S3, DynamoDB, Athena, Glue, CFN, EC2, Redshift

## "What is a feature you would like to see AWS implement?"

Re:Invent was last week! I have so much catching up to do. Ask me again next year.

## "What do you think about the serverless computing paradigm that has emerged in the past couple years?"

Passing off responsibility for boring-but-important infrastructure tasks to the CSPs is wonderful. This and the pay-for-use billing model makes it easier for small teams to do big things.
